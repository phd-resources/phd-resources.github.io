Do you need some help with your research?
Here is a collection of cool resources, websites and software to improve your workflow and make your life easier!
They can be useful to anyone, including students at all levels, academic researchers, and scientists in other institutions.

This is meant to be a collaborative endeavor, so if you have things to add, you can contribute by filing an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phd-resources/phd-resources.github.io).

> Disclaimer: I have not tested all of these tools myself, and their descriptions are mostly taken from Wikipedia or their own websites. Be sure to check that each one is safe and adequate for your work before relying on it.
