## Networking

### Social networks

Researchers are very active on social networks, both for research communication and more personal interactions.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/): A business and employment-focused social media platform.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/): An online social media and social networking service.
- [Orcid](https://orcid.org/): Provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. You can connect your iD with your professional information â€” affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more.

### Building a website

Having your own website is essential for visibility, to showcase your CV and publications.

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/): A web content management system. It was originally created as a tool to publish blogs but has evolved to support publishing other web content, including more traditional websites.
- [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/): A simple and intuitive platform to build websites.
- [GitHub Pages + Jekyll](https://pages.github.com/): Websites for you and your projects, hosted and deployed directly from a GitHub repository. Some templates:
  - [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/)
  - [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/)
  - [BeautifulJekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)
